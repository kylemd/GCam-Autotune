# This implementation uses a stop_event object to signal the threads to stop running. 
# The execute_monitor_and_take_photo function checks the stop_event object at the start of each iteration of the loop, and if it is set, 
# the loop exits and the thread stops running.

# To stop the thread, you simply need to set the stop_event object by calling stop_event.set(), and then join the thread to wait for it to finish. 
# The join method will block until the thread has finished executing. Note that the thread will only stop running once the loop in the 
# execute_monitor_and_take_photo function has completed its current iteration and checked the stop_event object again.
